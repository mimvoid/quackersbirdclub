We're a group of birders based in Philadelphia, particularly around the
Penn campus!

You can find us hosting a variety of fun events, from small hikes at the
[BioPond]({{% relref "resources/birding-spots#biopond" %}}), to trips to
[Bartram's Garden]({{% relref "resources/birding-spots#bartrams-garden" %}}),
to having brunch at 1920 Commons.

We appreciate the wildlife this planet has to offer, and we care for birds and
the issues they face.

## History

We began as a small informal group founded by Victoria Sindlinger in Fall 2023.
In a year, our membership grew and we became an official club in Fall 2024.

We still carry the same atmosphere from back then, and membership is open and welcome!
